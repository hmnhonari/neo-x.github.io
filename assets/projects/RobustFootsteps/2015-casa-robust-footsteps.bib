abstract = {Recent agent-based steering methods abandon the standard particle abstraction of an agent's locomotion abilities and employ more complex models from timed footsteps to physics-based controllers. 
These models often provide the action space of an optimal search method that plans a sequence of steering actions for each agent that minimize a performance criterion. 
The transition from particle-based models to more complex models is not straightforward and gives rise to a number of technical challenges. 
For example, a disk geometry is constant, symmetric and convex, while a footstep model maybe non-convex and dynamic.
In this paper, we identify general challenges associated with footstep-based steering approaches and present a new space-time footstep planning steering model that is robust to challenging scenario configurations.},
