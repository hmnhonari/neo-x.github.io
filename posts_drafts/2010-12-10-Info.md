summary: I am a PostDoc at the <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)</a> group working in the <a href="http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Robotic AI & Learning Lab (RAIL)</a> lab with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/">Sergey Levine</a>. I received my PhD at the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in 2019 where I worked on reinforcement learning, machine learning and motion planning with <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/">Michiel van de Panne</a>. I received my BSc degree in Computer Science from York University in 2012 and my MSc from York University under the supervision of <a href="www.cse.yorku.ca/~pfal/">Petros Faloutsos</a> in 2014 for optimization and authoring crowd simulations. I have published in a wide range of areas including computer animation, machine learning and robotics and was an NSERC scholarship award winner.
