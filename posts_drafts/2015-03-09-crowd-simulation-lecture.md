title: Crowd Simulation Lecture
date: '2015-03-09T13:55:00.003-07:00'
author: Glen Berserth
summary: I recently gave a lecture on Crowd simulation. This lecture outlines some of the popular steering algorithms and then some of my work on making them even better via parameter optimization. You can find the presentation <a href="http://fracturedplane.com/presentations/CrowdSimulation/CrowdSimulation.html#/" target="_blank">here</a>.
