<p>The Environment Interface Standard was a project that started in the Clausthal University of Technology. The idea is to create a standard for interfacing environmentes for agent programming. It is very often that agents are written in another langauge than the environment they need to operate in, the interface would provide facilities to ease integration of agents into there operating environments</p>

<p>The version of the Interface Standard created is very different from the one offered from the Clausthal University of Technology. Agents are created all the time in many different languages to support all of them is difficult. This interface is designed to help agents speaking different languages in different environments communicate. The example given was used to interface agents written in IndiGolog with Entitys written in UnrealScript.</p>
