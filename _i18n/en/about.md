I am an assistant professor at the <a href="https://diro.umontreal.ca/accueil/">Université de Montréal</a>, a core academic member of the <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila - Quebec AI Institute</a>, <a href="https://cifar.ca/ai/canada-cifar-ai-chairs/">Canada CIFAR AI chair</a>, member <a href="https://institut-courtois.umontreal.ca/">L'Institut Courtois</a>, and co-director of the <a href="https://montrealrobotics.ca/">Robotics and Embodied AI Lab (REAL)</a>. 
    I was a Postdoctoral Researcher with <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)</a>, working with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/">Sergey Levine</a>. 
    My current research focuses on machine learning and solving real-world sequential decision-making problems (planning/RL), such as robotics, scientific discovery and adaptive clean technology. The specifics of this research has covered the areas of human-robot collaboration, generalization, reinforcement learning, continual learning, meta-learning, multi-agent learning, and hierarchical learning. I also teaches courses on data science and robot learning at Université de Montréal and Mila, covering the most recent research on machine learning techniques for creating generalist agents. I have also co-created a <a  href="https://rl-conference.cc/">new conference for reinforcement learning research</a>.
